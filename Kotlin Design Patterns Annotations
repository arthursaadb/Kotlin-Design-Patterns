Kotlin Design Patterns Annotations

1) Creational Patterns

1.1) Singleton
- Only one instance.
- Uses: network manager, database access, logging, utility class(es).

1.2) Factory
- Provides a way to acess functionality without caring about implementation.
- Provides separation of concerns.
- Testability.
 
1.3) Abstract Factory
- Provides a way to acess functionality without caring about implementation and also without caring where we get that object, where we get that data and how we get it.
- Provides separation of concerns.
- Testability.

1.4) Builder
- Used when have multiple parameters to intialize and some of which are optional.

1.5) Lazy Initialization
- Useful technique for memory management.
- Initialize a resource when it's needed, not when declared.
- Only used for large objects.

1.6) Prototype
- Copy existing objects withou need to know how the class works.
- The copy object must provide the copy functionality.

2) Behavioural Patterns

2.1) Observer

2.2) Chain of responsibility
- Define a chain of handlers to process a request
- Each handler contains a reference to the next handler
- Each handler decides to process the request AND / OR pass it on
- Request can be of different types

2.3) Command
- A request is wrapped in an object that contains all request info
- The command object is passed to the correct handler

2.4) Strategy
 - A class behaviour or algorithm can be changed at run time
 - Objects contain algorithm logic
 - Context object tha can handle algorithm objects
 - Useful when we want to be able to add functionality without changing program strcuture
